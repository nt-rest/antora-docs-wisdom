= How To Compile

== Prerequisites 

=== Mandatory

* Microsoft(TM) Visual Studio(TM) 2019. Community Edition is good enough.
** Desktop Development with C++
** MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (v14.26)
** Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0)
* Internet connection.

=== Optional

* A git client to check out source code. Downloading archive file is fine.

== Compilation

* Download source code
+
.Recommended: check out source code with git client
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/nt-rest/nt-rest.git
+
.NOT recommended: download and unpack archive with source code
[source,bash]
curl -L -o nt-rest.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/nt-rest/nt-rest/tarball/ +
tar -xf nt-rest.tar.gz
+
* Read all licenses under `.\licenses\` directory. Really do.

* Open `nt-rest.sln` with Microsoft(TM) Visual Studio(TM).
* Select solution platform matching platform type of your machine, either `x64` or `x86`. To figure out platform type of your machine, execute +
+
[source,bash]
systeminfo | findstr /C:"System Type"

* Build. It may take some time.
* Find results under `.\executables\` directory.
